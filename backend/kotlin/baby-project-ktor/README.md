# Baby Project Ktor POC
this project was created to evaluate which is better for our use case, Spring Boot or Ktor
## Getting Started
### Docker
(comming soon)!
### Manual
1. Install java 11 (we recommend [Jenv](https://www.jenv.be/))
1. run `./gradlew application:run`
1. Open browser `http://localhost:8080`

No need for node in this porject since the UI is built with a CDN hosted version of tailwind
and the code is POJ (Plain old javascript)
